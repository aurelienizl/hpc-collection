# HPC Collection - Compressed Libraries

This directory contains compressed libraries and benchmarks for HPC (High Performance Computing) applications, such as OpenMPI, OpenBLAS, HPCC, HPL, and others.

**All libraries and benchmarks included here are original, unmodified packages obtained directly from their official sources.**

## Folder Structure

- Each library, benchmark, or tool has its own parent folder, named in **lowercase**.
- Inside each folder, the packaged solution is provided as a `.tar.gz` archive.
- The archive is named using the format:  
    `[parent-folder-name]-[version].tar.gz`

### Example

For OpenMPI version `x.x`, the expected path is:
```
openmpi/openmpi-x.x.tar.gz
```

Follow this structure for all libraries and benchmarks in this collection.
